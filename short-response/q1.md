# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer
The two arguments that `useEffect` accepts effect callback function and dependency array. The callback function is a function that contains the code you want to run after the component renders. How dependency is important because, when it's a empty dependency array `useEffect(() => {}, [])` it only runs once after initial render. When there's no dependency `useEffect(() => {})`, it runs on every render. If it has dependencies `useEffect(() => {}, [dependency1, dependency2])` it runs when specified dependencies change.
